\t\t\t\t<span class=\"aboutus-header\">Welcome to our wedding website,
\t\t\t\t\tand thank you for visiting!</span>

\t\t\t\t<p>Vitaly has poured a great deal of work into this website, so
\t\t\t\t\twe are planning to use it to its fullest potential! Feel free to
\t\t\t\t\tread some information about us!
\t\t\t\t<p>In exciting news, we are changing RSVP traditions! We have
\t\t\t\t\tdecided to embrace Vitaly's tech-savvy self, and are opting for a
\t\t\t\t\tcomplete on-line RSVP area. Look forward to this in the formal
\t\t\t\t\tinvitation!
\t\t\t\t<p>Anyway, please enjoy browsing the website; hopefully you find
\t\t\t\t\tsome useful maps or information. If you don't find anything
\t\t\t\t\tuseful...well, our apologies. Field all complaints to Kendra (at
\t\t\t\t\tyour own risk).
\t\t\t\t<p>
\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"aboutus-header\">Thanks for your support, we

\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"purple-emphasis garamondItalic small-font\">We
\t\t\t\t\t\tmet in 2007,</span> when we both worked as sales associates at GFS.
\t\t\t\t\tKendra decided early on that she was going to date Vitaly one day,
\t\t\t\t\tand she set the wheels in motion to make that happen. Her acts of
\t\t\t\t\tvalor included dragging her roommate to KFC to bring Vitaly lunch,
\t\t\t\t\tmeeting Vitaly at midnight to get coney island food from a sketchy
\t\t\t\t\testablishment, and saving up dirty laundry so she could stay at
\t\t\t\t\tVitaly's for hours while completing it (free laundry for a college
\t\t\t\t\tstudent is a great incentive).
\t\t\t\t<p>
\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"purple-emphasis garamondItalic small-font\">We've
\t\t\t\t\t\tcome a long way </span>since then. Vitaly proposed to Kendra in November
\t\t\t\t\tof 2012. There was music, rose petals, notes, and ugly-sobs of
\t\t\t\t\tcelebration (we'll let you guess from whom). It's been an awesome
\t\t\t\t\tjourney, and we are grateful to our friends and family for having a
\t\t\t\t\thand in making the people we are today.
